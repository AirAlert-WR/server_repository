## Steps for configuring the AWS Cloud

Make sure you have logged in with a valid cloud account, **preferably with administrator rights**. If not existent, please create one or contact your administrator.

1. **Database configuration**: proceed [here](database/)
2. **Storage configuration**: proceed [here](storage/)
3. **IoT and Lambda configuration**: proceed [here](IoT + Lambda/)

### I'm promising:

If the development continues in future, I'll **rewrite these instruction** to "something more deployable".
Also, I'm planning to convert this repository into the **main cloud deployment configuration using AWS CDK**, which significantly simplifies the process and minimizes import or configuration errors.
Be patient therefore...
